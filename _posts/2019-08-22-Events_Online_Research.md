**AUDIENCE**
- 45 from Userzoom Onlime Panel

**Focus**
- SEP Events

**Observations**
- Filters worked quite well
- Use of the map is a matter of preference and is fairly evenly split
- People expect to be able to search by both./either Post Code and Town
- Milage options need to cover a lot of distance and granularity to reflect the different sensibilities between central belt and more rural areas of Scotland.
The numbers change between Support & Events. Neither of these numbers matched with the number on the home page (because that is the sum of both of these). This confused people
