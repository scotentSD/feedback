**Audience**
- Internal & Partner users

**Focus**
- Internal research on the potential accessibility impact for the internal users

**Observations**
- The potential risk is mostly Umbraco which is the only new system internal staff will be using
- The rest won’t be any worse than it is at the moment as it’s their As-Is processes mostly
- One potential risk to keep in mind is how we deal with the regular communications among partners in the future and during the onboarding process
- Reporting to review once we know more about what form it will take
