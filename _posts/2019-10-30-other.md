SEP Customer UAT
**Audience**
-

**Focus**
- Customer UAT - End to End testing
- Feedback email content, testing

**Observations**
- The site was praised for being clean and easy to use
- The meta data on Support Options and Events was widely praised at it negated the need to pogo in and out of listings to check the basics
- Issue: It is not being obvious when a link is jumping off to another website
- Issue: The grey footer was modestly criticised, (only on the homepage), but only in the absence of anything serious to point out
- Issue: No method for reusing the address/company search after initial use.
