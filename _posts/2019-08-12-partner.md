**AUDIENCE**
- PARTNERS

**Focus**
Playback our results for partners portal with the wider team - technical interviews about enquiry handling
- services content management: sense making with the wider team and partners
- enquiry handling - more interviews with partners and EFRS

**Observations**
Refined needs
- The only thing we really need a portal for is to manage service content, reporting can be done elsewhere and no time to build a Knowledge Base from scratch so will use the existing KB

Decisions
- Decision to use Umbraco for service content management
