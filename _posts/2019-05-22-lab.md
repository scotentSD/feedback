**Audience**
- 5 business owners or Senior Decision makers

**Focus**
- General Usability Testing
- Usability testing (End to End)

**Observations**
- Issue: TRUST is still an issue because people are not sure who the site is. Gov.Scot helps but does not fully remove the issue.
- Issue: Information density is too low on the search listing pages
- Location is the top requested filter option
- Company Stage/Size is the next most requested filter option
- Address lookup still has issues and needs to be improved
- Search is not returning partial matches from incomplete strings (Scot should find Scottish)

**Documents**
- [May 22nd Findings (PDF)](../files/SEP_2019_may_22_usability.pdf)
