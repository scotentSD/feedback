**Audience**
- 15 Unmoderated and 3 Face to Face

**Focus**
- Test Feedback options for Null Results scenario

**Observations**
- Top Right or Bottom Right, is where people expect to see a phone number
- People are pretty split on Phone vs Email vs Form Vs Chat
- If Chat is there then it HAS to be a real person behind it
- When time is limited, people are more likely to fire off an email and wait for a response
- If they are in a rush, then they would call.
- Forms only make sense to people with spare time and not in a rush
- Forms inherently breed distrust and need work done to overcome this
- Short Forms are OK. Long Forms lead to people just phoning instead
- The options displayed got generically favourable responses
