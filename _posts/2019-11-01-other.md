At Taylor McKenzie - Glasgow - Lab
**Audience**
- 5 SME staff with a variety of Cognitive Issues

**Focus**
- Testing SEP with customer experiencing Cognitive Issues
- Customer UAT - End to End testing

**Observations**
- Issue around not opening a new tab when clicking on a Service/Product. It currently DOES open a new tab for Events
- Issue around not being obvious when a link is jumping off to another website
- The site was so clean that it did not raise any Cognitive Issue Specific problems apart from minor content alterations that could be made. These centred around "Giving the reasons behind strong statements made on pages". This could be shortened to "Tell me why..."

**Documents**
