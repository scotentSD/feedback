**Scot Export Event**
- Nov 12th 2019 at the Glasgow Technology Innovation Centre

**Audience**
- Circa 800 Exporters or people looking to export

**We were focusing on**
- Testing Feedback emails (ratings and surveys)
- Testing options to improve the jump from our site to external events providers sites (usually partners)
- Preferences around complaints
- Researching assisted digital experiences and preferences

**What we discovered about the Event Links**
- People preferred the text {% include yellowA.html %}"This link opens a different website in a new tab"{% include yellowB.html %} over "This link opens in a new tab"
- People {% include yellowA.html %}prefer the text ABOVE the link button{% include yellowB.html %} (they say it flows better)
- The shorter text prototype had no whitespace in between it and the text above which may have reduced it's popularity
- Quote "The text above is clearer to understand"
- Quote "The text above the button tells you what it is going to do before it does"

**What we discovered about the feedback/rating emails**
- The emails have too much text and people just wouldn't read it
- If people were happy or angry about FindBusinessSupport help received then they would just click on the rating scale and not bother about the text.

**What we learned about complaints**
- Most people said they would complain by phone BECAUSE it would be dealt with quickly an it would be a HUMAN interaction that would avoid sending emails back and forth
- Some said they would complain via any known contact that they had with us

**What we discovered in general**
- Not as much chat around Brexit as in previous events
- Lots of people are aware of SDI and have had dealings with them
- Many (but fewer than for SDI) have heard of Globalscot and some have had dealings
